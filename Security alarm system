ABSTRACT:
   Security is becoming a major issue everywhere. Home Security is becoming necessary nowadays as the possibilities of intrusion is increasing day by day.
  The need for home security alarm systems nowadays is a serious demand. As the number of crimes are 
increasing every day, there has to be something that will keep us safe. We are all aware of the high end 
security systems present in the market but they are not easily available to everyone. We therefore intend 
to provide a solution by constructing a cost efficient electronic system that has the capability of sensing 
the motion of the intruders and setting off the alarm. The basic idea behind this project is that all the 
bodies generate some heat energy in the form of infrared which is invisible to human eyes. But, it can 
be detected by electronic motion sensor. 
The project involves the use of Arduino, motion sensor, buzzer, LCD display and a simple program. 
The sensor detect any motion in its permissible range and triggers the alarm.
It will also send the signal to Arduino which processes the signal and set off the alarm along with 
detection message on display. With this system we can easily set up a security alarm in our home for 
unwanted intruders
